## Project Introduction

Three-Body Civilization Simulator is a web-based interactive 3D simulator that combines the world view of Liu Cixin's science fiction novel *Three-Body Problem* with real three-body motion physics. This project not only simulates chaotic three-body motion systems but also creatively integrates the rise and fall of civilizations with changes in the cosmic environment, allowing users to experience the beauty of celestial motion while contemplating the meaning of civilization and survival.

> "Give civilization to time, not time to civilization"

## Core Features

### 3D Three-Body Motion Simulation
- Realistic physics simulation based on the law of universal gravitation
- Visual display of complex motion trajectories of three stars (α, β, γ) and planet (P)
- Support for 3D view rotation, zooming, and focusing on specific celestial bodies
- Real-time display of key information such as simulation time and planetary surface temperature

### Civilization Rise and Fall Simulation
- Simulate the impact of temperature changes on planet P's surface on civilization
- Divide civilization development into seven stages: Primitive Age, Feudal Age, Steam Age, Electrical Age, Atomic Age, Information Age, and Interstellar Exploration Age
- Record the existence time, development stage, and final outcome of each civilization
- Civilization outcomes include: destruction by high temperature, destruction by low temperature, or successful flight to a new home

### Interactive Experience
- New Game: Randomly generate a brand-new three-body system configuration
- Restart Simulation: Reset the simulation with current parameters
- Adjust Simulation Speed: Ranging from 0.1x to 300x
- First-Person Mode: Immersive experience of the three-body world
- Export/Import Parameters: Save and share your three-body system configurations

### Three-Body Quotes Carousel
- Display more than 50 classic quotes from *Three-Body Problem* novels
- Automatically switch as the simulation progresses, creating a strong science fiction atmosphere

## User Guide

### Basic Operations
- **Single-finger drag**: Rotate the view
- **Two-finger pinch**: Adjust field of view size
- **Double-click on a celestial body**: Focus on that celestial body
- **Single-click on a celestial body**: View detailed information about the celestial body

### Control Panel
- **New Game**: Generate a random three-body system
- **Restart Simulation**: Reset current simulation state
- **First-Person View**: Switch to first-person mode
- **Show Three-Body Civilization History**: View recorded civilization history
- **Export Parameters**: Save current system configuration
- **Import Parameters**: Load external system configuration

## Technical Features

- **Front-end only implementation**: Built with HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript, no back-end required
- **Responsive design**: Supports both desktop and mobile access
- **Local storage**: Uses localStorage to save civilization history records
- **High-performance rendering**: Optimized 3D projection algorithm to ensure smooth simulation experience
- **Physical accuracy**: Calculates celestial motion based on real law of universal gravitation

## Online Demo

## Project Origin

Initially, this project was called "Web-based Online Three-Body Motion Simulator" and only had the function of simulating three-body motion according to user-input parameters.

But when the "quote carousel" feature was added, the connotation of this project had already changed. Civilizations trying to survive in the chaotic three-body system are destroyed in the epic of ice and fire thousands of times, and then are reborn.

Perhaps only when we face the collapse and reconstruction of civilizations again and again can we truly understand what Liu Cixin said: "Survival has never been a matter of course; we just mistakenly take it as a matter of course."

## Special Thanks

- Liu Cixin, author of the *Three-Body Problem* series and Hugo Award winner
- Netlify for providing free GitHub repository synchronization
- A total of 2,752 three-body civilizations that were destroyed during program testing and 147 three-body civilizations that successfully flew to new homes (doge)

May we all find our own light of civilization in this chaotic universe.
